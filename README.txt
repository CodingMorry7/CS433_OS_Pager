Instructions:
Setup:
Make sure that the directory has all of our headers, .cpp files, and our Makefile.
1)Type "make" in the directory to where you want to run the program.
2)After typing make and executable is made called: "cs433_hw5"
3)To run the program type: "./cs433_hw5 <int> <int>"
**NOTE** - The two ints are for two raise to. So if you want 256 for the page size,
then type "8" for the first <int>.The first int is for page size, and the second int is for physical memory size. MAKE SURE that physical memory size is bigger than page size.
